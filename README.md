### Machine Learning
Hypothyroid disease or Hypothyroidism is one of the most difficult diseases to diagnose. It is a condition which causes your thyroid gland to not produce enough of certain crucial hormones. It usually may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages and hence becomes extremely difficult to diagnose. 
Applying deep learning algorithms can help assist healthcare workers in identifying signs and symptoms based on patterns shown in past cases of patients' data.

#### The following steps will be followed in conducting this study:
1.Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.
2. Read and explore the given dataset.
3. Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
5. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording our observations.
6. Performing prediction using any of the two models Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.
7. Perform optimization on our dataset by tuning our hyperparameters
8. Perfom Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build your SVM model and then evaluate their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best.
